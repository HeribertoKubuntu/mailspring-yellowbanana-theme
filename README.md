# Mailspring Matcha Theme Version: yellowbanana
This is my adaptation of Matcha theme by [jakubzet](https://github.com/jakubzet) for Mailspring E-mail Client.

The original Matcha theme is work of Vince - check his awesome piece of work in [Matcha GTK repository](https://github.com/vinceliuice/matcha). Kudos for the author for a wonderful theme and inspiration!
